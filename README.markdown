### Swipe movies in Netflix like people on Tinder

Check out the [demo gif](https://github.com/brentvatne/tinder-netflix/blob/master/demo.gif).
Be warned, it's 6mb, so you might not want to if you're on a mobile device.

I built this in one day as a quick tool for myself and my friends to use.
There's a lot of low hanging fruit to improve on the front end:

- Animation performance
- Loading indicators
- More information on the cards (have a bunch in the database for each
  title, thanks to allflicks.net)
- Expand to have option to switch between countries
- Better auth/backend
- Higher res images
- Better aesthetics overall

etc...

Feel free to submit a pull request. If you'd like to and don't know how
to get started, shoot me an email at brentvatne@gmail.com and I'll help
you out.
